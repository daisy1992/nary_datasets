Professor Memmott is an anthropologist/architect and the Director of the Aboriginal Environments Research Centre (AERC), a research and resource centre, based in the UQ School of Architecture but with staffing and logistical support also coming from UQ's Institute for Social Science Research.

AERC has been constructed within the theoretical framework of behaviour-environment studies and environmental psychology that emerged in the 1960s/70s. Paul Memmott's early studies were in architecture and painting.

His dual research interests during the 1970s, centred on the emerging discipline of people-environment relations and the use of space and place by Aboriginal people, and led him into the architectural anthropology and the social anthropology of Aboriginal Australia, a field in which the University of Queensland was a leader in the 1970s.

Professor Memmott's doctorate examined the Properties of Place of the Lardil people of the Wellesley Islands in the Gulf of Carpentaria. By the early 1980s Paul was professionally qualified and practicing as both an architect and anthropologist, and diverging into allied areas such as settlement planning, social planning, strategic and management planning, social issue analysis, Aboriginal social organisation and land tenure.

He was also the principal of a research consultancy practice in Aboriginal projects during 1980 to 2008, which provides specialised services to Aboriginal organisations and government departments throughout Australia.

He is the author of some 9 books and 220 other publications on Indigenous cultural topics.

He is the author of Gunyah, Goondie & Wurley: the Aboriginal Architecture of Australia (2007) which won several national book prizes including the Stanner Prize of the Australian Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies.
